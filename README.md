# 🚀 DSA Journey — by Jeevan Chavan

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey**!  
This repository is my personal log of solving DSA problems every day — consistently learning, practicing, and improving my problem-solving skills.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- 🧠 Strengthen core problem-solving ability.  
- 💻 Solve at least **1 DSA problem daily**.  
- 🧩 Cover all important topics (Arrays → Graphs → DP).  
- 📈 Build a strong DSA profile visible on GitHub.

## 🧠 Learning Strategy

1. Start each topic from basics.  
2. Solve 2–3 problems of increasing difficulty.  
3. Write a short explanation before code.  
4. Review code after 2–3 days to improve.  
5. Maintain a daily GitHub streak 💚
